# Social Network API

## Description
This is the API for a social network platform that doesn't connect to a front end deployment, but instead simply displays the functionality of connecting to a MongoDB database and routing data using Exprss.js to show users, their posted thoughts, and reactions to those thoughts from associated users labeled as "friends." We use the Mongoose npm package to make the connection to the database and manipulate the data with the controller files. Functionality is shown using Insomnia Core.
